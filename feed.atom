Woh, a new section?! No, this is just an exceptional section that will spawn from time to time to provide you with some
information about https://this-week-in-neovim.org itself.
This TWiN #16 is a special weekly update, so I need to make a small announcement in your feed to ensure people read
this right away. I (@phaazon) took the time this week to update the Rust library I use to
parse the weekly updates (called twin). Next week, for TWiN #17, the contribution process changes a bit, following
the changes I introduced in twin-0.2. If you have already contributed to TWiN or plan to, then you will probably want
to read the following updated section on the
README. If not, jump directly to
the next section!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neovim Core updates
Updates of Neovim itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.
Important: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
#14090 breaking changes on master GitHub thread, as it contains
important breaking changes information.
#20428 removes filetype.vim in favor of the now default filetype.lua.
(If you install from the repo, make sure to clean out /usr/local/share/nvim/runtime before make install.)
The filetype detection logic and tests still align with Vim, so additions or changes still need to be contributed
there first and then ported to Neovim.
