spellsitter merged to core!. A
huge contribution by @lewis6991 and @vigoux. If you did not know, spellsitter is a tree-sitter powered spell
checking mechanism that only checks spells for specified queries. This allows checking only relevant parts such as
comments or markdown text for spelling errors. (#19419)
#15391 adds tree-sitter parsers and queries for core languages (C, Lua
and VimL).
Neovim now bundles parsers and highlight queries for Lua, Vimscript, and C; by default the former are installed in
/usr/local/lib/nvim/parseâ€¦]]></summary>

#20020 introduced the following breaking changes:

nvim_get_keymap now always returns a LuaRef object as callback for a Lua mapping regardless of how it is
called. The LuaRef object can be called from Lua and Vim script, but is lost over RPC.
maparg() now returns a Funcref instead of a ref number as callback for a Lua mapping. The Funcref can be
called from Lua and Vim script, but is lost over RPC.

#19862 changed the behavior of fargs in Lua callbacks for
nvim_create_user_command with nargs='?' to match the behavior of nargs='*' if no arguments were provided
(fargs = {} instead of fargs = { "" }).
#19743 changed Vim functions winheight(), winwidth(),
getwininfo() to return inner window width and height. In non-multigrid UI the only change is that the returned
height now excludes winbar, and this is compatible with Vim. In multigrid UI this means the return value of these
functions now reflect the space available for buffeâ€¦]]></summary>

#19693: changed the nightly (and release) builds and
appimages to be built on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of Ubuntu 18.04, which is
being deprecated by Github.
This means that Linux releases (including app images) from now on require GLIBC 2.29 or above. Users that cannot
upgrade their distribution need to
build from source instead.
