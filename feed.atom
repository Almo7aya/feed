nvim-0.8 freeze
(text extracted from the Reddit post by u/bfredl):
As of today, Neovim nighty is entering the feature freeze period for the upcoming 0.8 release. No further features
will be merged for 0.8, just bug fixes and documentation improvements (and possibly minor adjustments to new
features/API).
The preliminary release date for 0.8 is 30 September (as has been our aim for some time), but might get delayed if
needed for critical bug fixes to land. As an example, cmdheight=0 feature recently received a larger change in

spellsitter merged to core!. A
huge contribution by @lewis6991 and @vigoux. If you did not know, spellsitter is a tree-sitter powered spell
checking mechanism that only checks spells for specified queries. This allows checking only relevant parts such as
comments or markdown text for spelling errors. (#19419)
#15391 adds tree-sitter parsers and queries for core languages (C, Lua
and VimL).
Neovim now bundles parsers and highlight queries for Lua, Vimscript, and C; by default the former are installed in

#20020 introduced the following breaking changes:

nvim_get_keymap now always returns a LuaRef object as callback for a Lua mapping regardless of how it is
called. The LuaRef object can be called from Lua and Vim script, but is lost over RPC.
maparg() now returns a Funcref instead of a ref number as callback for a Lua mapping. The Funcref can be
called from Lua and Vim script, but is lost over RPC.
